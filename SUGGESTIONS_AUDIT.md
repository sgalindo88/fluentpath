## Not Implemented — Low Effort, Worth Doing (7)

| # | Suggestion | Effort | Impact | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| **2.1** | Standardise var/const/let | Low | Code quality | Run `npm run lint:fix` + manual pass to convert remaining `var` to `const`/`let` |
| **2.6** | Console warnings swallowed silently | Low | Reliability | Add lightweight error counter; show "Some data may not have saved" warning after multiple catch blocks fire |
| **3.4** | postForm truncates at 2,000 chars | Low | Data integrity | Increase limit to 10,000+ or warn the user when truncation occurs; long writing responses are currently clipped |
| **5.5** | Dark mode / high-contrast | Medium | Accessibility | Add `prefers-color-scheme: dark` media query with CSS variable overrides; add toggle switch |
| **5.6** | Student progress not visible during lessons | Low | UX | Day X/20 badge already in nav bar; could enhance with a small progress arc or percentage |
| **7.2** | localStorage has no expiry or cleanup | Low | Reliability | Add timestamp to cached entries; purge stale data (>30 days) on app load; warn when approaching 5MB limit |
| **9.3** | Checkpoint recovery edge cases | Low | Reliability | Add version field to checkpoints; use double-buffer (save to `_a` and `_b` alternately) to survive mid-save crashes |

## Not Implemented — Medium/High Effort, Future Consideration (6)

| # | Suggestion | Effort | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|
| **1.3** | Shared MCQ component (renderMCQ, renderRecorder) | Medium | Would reduce ~200 lines of duplication across student-test.js, student-lesson.js, and examiner-panel.js; requires refactoring render functions to use a common API |
| **1.5** | Global state objects without structure | Medium | A `createState(defaults)` pattern with key validation; risky refactor for code that currently works |
| **2.3** | Replace string concatenation with h() helper or tagged templates | Medium | Would catch structural HTML errors and improve readability; large refactor touching every render function |
| **4.1** | Asset bundling / minification | Medium | esbuild for JS concat + minify + content hash filenames; not urgent at current file sizes (~13KB total JS) |
| **6.2** | Rate limiting on API endpoints | Medium | Use CacheService to track requests per student per hour; reject excessive requests; protects against quota exhaustion |
| **9.4** | Graceful degradation for Google Sheets downtime | Medium | Service worker (Step 4.1) partially addresses this; full solution would add a service worker that queues reads too, plus a persistent "offline mode" with write-ahead log |

---

## Not Applicable / Deferred (5+)

| # | Suggestion | Reason |
|---|-----------|--------|
| **6.5** | Claude API caching at server level | Already handled by lesson library recycling system + LockService preventing concurrent generation |
| **6.6** | Hardcoded teacher name | Still hardcoded (`ex.teacherName = 'Sebastian Galindo'`); would require a login system or teacher registration to fix properly |
| **7.1** | Google Sheets scaling limits | Not a concern for the current cohort size (<50 students); archive strategy documented but not needed yet |
| **7.4** | no-cors POST prevents error detection | Partially mitigated by save verification (read-back after write); full fix requires switching to CORS-enabled POST or a proxy |
| **8.3** | Student-to-student progress comparison | Nice-to-have with privacy considerations; anonymised class stats could be added to the hub |
| **8.7** | Printable/exportable lesson content | Nice-to-have; would use `@media print` CSS and a "Print this lesson" button |
| **8.8** | Web Speech API browser support gaps | Already shows a browser warning + text-input fallback recommendation; Whisper API integration would be a larger effort |
| **8.9** | RTL language support | Not needed for current Spanish-only i18n; noted for future Arabic/Farsi expansion |
| **9.2** | Client-side error monitoring (Sentry/LogRocket) | Error Log sheet covers server-side; client-side would need `window.onerror` + `onunhandledrejection` handlers posting to an error endpoint |
| **10.5** | DDEV configuration unused | Kept — the user actively uses DDEV for local development |
